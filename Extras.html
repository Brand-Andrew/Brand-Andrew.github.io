			            <p>
			                The Pest is a special zombie featured in Call of Duty: WWII's Nazi Zombies mode.
			                <h3><u>Appearance:</u></h3>
                            The specimen's status resembles other zombies from height to speed, but with a difference of its appearance and behaviour.
                            It appears as a very skinny zombie. 
                            Most of its muscles and organs have been scrapped off, leaving only a small amount of flesh on its skeletal system. 
                            Its skull is widely exposed and it has no arms to strike with. 
                            Another difference is its mechanical support that keeps the specimen alive. 
                            Flies can be seen swarming around the specimen.
                            <h3><u>Bestiary Overview:</u></h3>
                            The Pest emits a buzzing sound whenever its presence is revealed.
                            It deals the same amount of damage as the other zombies, however are much faster. 
                            When attacking the players, it does so by attempting to bite them due to the lack of arms.

                        <h1><u>Zombie Profile: Wustling</u></h1>
                        <img src="./img/Wustling.jpg" align="right">
                        <p>
                            The Wustling is a special zombie in Call of Duty: WWII's Nazi Zombies mode. 
                            This zombie serves as a brute-type enemy that charges its prey when enraged. 
                            Its English name likely stems from the fact that this type of zombie seems to not be very interested in the player, except when it is attacked, from which the Wüstling will charge at the player, dealing exceptional damage.
                            <h3><u>Appearance:</u></h3>
                                The specimen's upper torso is left exposed, leaving it as a vulnerable portion to attack. 
                                It has a the German Iron Cross stiched on its chest, and although deformed, it retains its muscular anatomy, acting as a durable biological armor, suggesting that in its past human life it was a strong and resilient soldier.
                                Its entire body is heavily augmented to support its nervous system. 
                                The equipment itself provides more protection for the specimen when under attack. 
                                Its spinal cord is accompanied with a retainer to keep it upright while walking. 
                                Its hand is replaced with a metallic spiked-blunt object or "claw" as described by Dr. Peter Straub mainly used as a weapon.
                            <h3><u>Bestiary Overview:</u></h3>
                                The Wustling moves fairly slowly. 
                                This may be due to the heavy weight of its blunt weapon. 
                                It also deals more damage when under firepower. 
                                There are two states of which this zombie will act.
                            <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                                <li>Neutral - Like other zombies, it will follow its prey. Moving slower than its non-militarized counterparts.</li>
                                <li>Enraged - When attacked, it will be outraged causing it on a violent rampage. 
                                It will attack by slamming its spiked-club on the ground. Its speed is higher than the average undead but can still be avoided.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The specimen in its past life may have been an easily tempered individual. 
                                This perhaps is the reason why it would charge through its prey when attacked.

		            <img src="./img/Brenner.jpg" align="right">
		            <p>
		                <p>
		                    The Brenner is a sub boss encountered in the Call of Duty: WWII Zombies maps The Final Reich and Gröesten Haus, and is a key part in the main quest within The Final Reich. 
		                    Brenners are large in size and are armed with a flamethrower which is their primary weapon. 
		                    Brenners are surprisingly agile despite their size and large fuel tank on their backs and can easily catch up to players, the fuel tank on the Brenner's back can be damaged which can lead to the tank exploding if damaged enough. 
		                    Upon death, the Brenner will drop its head which will be needed for the main quest of The Final Reich.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Gröesten Haus, a Brenner will spawn once the player reaches wave 50.
                        </p>
                    <h3><u>Apperance:</u></h3>
                    Brenners are large zombies equipped with large fuel tanks on their backs and a flamethrower, they also wear typical German solider helmets alongside a gas mask which covers their mouths. 
                    Alongside this, Brenners have bolts, tubing and metal plates attached to their arms, bodies and legs. 
                    Their eyes appear to have some mechanical augments as well.

		            <p>
		                Bombers are a zombie type that appear in the Call of Duty: WWII Nazi Zombies map The Final Reich. They appear to be two zombies fused together with the back facing zombie holding a big bomb which can be shot to create an explosion. If this zombie is killed without shooting the bomb, it will fall to the ground and can still be shot, making it useful in later waves. When a player is in their line of sight, they will begin to move faster in an attempt to detonate on the player.

		            <p>
		                Treasure Zombies are a rare and special type of zombies found in the Call of Duty: WWII Zombies map The Final Reich.
		            </p>
		            
		            <p>
		                <h3><u>Overview:</u></h3>
		                <p>
		                    Treasure Zombies are one of the rarest types of zombies that can spawn on the map.
		                    They have a similar appearance to that of Bombers, but have a red and yellow bomb on their back.
		                    They also drop Jolts, which the player can pick up.
		                    Treasure Zombies also do not attack the player, instead they walk around the map dropping Jolts for the player.
		                    They also have more health compared to a normal Bomber.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    The player is notified of when a Treasure Zombie appears on the map when Jolts will randomly begin to appear somewhere within the map. 
		                    Killing a Treasure Zombie will grant the player a random power-up, and occasionally will drop a piece for the Hunter character.
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                    A Treasure Zombie will sometimes spawn once the player completely opens the Ubersprengen.

		            <p>
		                The Panzermörder is the final boss in the Call of Duty: WWII Nazi Zombies map The Final Reich. 
		                Its name translates into "armor-killer", which may allude to the fact that he drops the player's armor very rapidly.
		                <p>
		                   When attacking, Panzermörder depletes one armor per hit. 
		                </p>
		                <p>
		                   The Panzermörder is a massive enemy, towering several meters above the player characters and all zombie types. 
		                   It is constructed out of both metal and flesh. 
		                   Mechanical joints can be seen sticking out of its knees, while its mouth is made of several human heads, and its hands and feet are made of individual limbs. 
		                   Klaus Fischer, still alive, is stuck in the center of the monster.

		                    The Ubersprengen is a utility featured in Call of Duty: WWII Nazi Zombies, found in The Final Reich, as well as in a small easter egg within Gröesten Haus. It is essentially the Pack-a-Punch Machine from previous Zombies installments. Unlike its predecessor however, the Ubersprengen can resupply ammo to any non-wonder weapons, including weapons that aren't normally found from Weapon Lockers, such as Mystery Box weapons. This can be done for 4,000 Jolts once the weapon the player wishes to restock is upgraded.
                        </p>
                        <h3><u>The Final Reich:</u></h3>
                        <p>
                            The Ubersprengen is located in the heart of the sewers.
                            It can be found encased by a bone-like cage. 
                            Directly in front of the MP-40 weapon locker, there is a red button the player must press.
                            Pressing it will cause the cage to slightly rise and open the three Disposal Tubes around the map.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The player must now use all three Disposal Tubes around the map. 
                            Doing so will bring the player into a cage in the sewer, which will immediately rise and turn on a button in the cage. 
                            Pressing the button will cause the cage to rise even more.
                            Doing this until all three button are pressed will unlock the Ubersprengen for the rest of the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Occasionally, when the player presses a button in a cage, sometimes the button won't work immediately, triggering an event which causes the whole room to be engulfed by a red fog, with several Pests spawning in.
                            The player must eliminate the Pests before the part of the cage will rise up automatically.
                        </p>
                        <h3><u>Gröesten Haus:</u></h3>
                        <p>
                            In Gröesten Haus, the machine doesn't directly appear in the map, although weapons in the map can still be upgraded. 
                            To do this, the player first must aqcuire the Jack-in-the-Box from the Mystery Box. 
                            When the player obtains the Jack-in-the-Box, they must throw one onto one of the wooden support beams above the staircase closest to the MP-40, where a visable Jack-in-the-Box logo can be seen. 
                            Once the Jack-in-the-Box explodes, the player must now acquire 10,000 Jolts and interact with the piano outside of the Mystery Box room. 
                            The piano will take the 10,000 Jolts from the player, but as a result, all of the weapons in the Mystery Box will now be upgraded.
